# DBSCAN

We'll be discussing the **d**ensity-**b**ased **s**patial **c**lustering of **a**pplications with **n**oise method in class, April 11th.  The slides can be found on Moodle as well as in this repository.

I do not have skeleton code to offer.  However, using the pseudocode you have from class discussion and the notes, you should be able to figure out a creative method!  You may check your work on the built-in methods provided by R and Python.

* If you create a working program by **April 20th**, you will receive full credit on the assignment.
* If you create a working program by April 20th in both Python and R, you will receive full credit and bonus points.
* If you create a working program by **April 25th** in both Python and R, type up a lab report (must be turned in as pdf) discussing your implementations, providing 2 visual examples (not of the half moons) of its success, and comparing the programs in the different languages (such as discussing cpu time difference, differences in results, and how much simpler R is versus Python), you will receive full credit, bonus points, and I will replace your lowest quiz grade with this assignment.
